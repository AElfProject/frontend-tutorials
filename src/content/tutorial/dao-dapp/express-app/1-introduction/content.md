# Welcome to DAO aApp

Hey there, and welcome to DAO aApp ðŸ‘‹!

#### Description

This is the slightly more complex dApp in this guide. It covers mechanisms of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dApp including creating a proposal, vote on a proposal, fetch all proposals, security considerations, and advanced data structures to ensure a fair and transparent DAO processes.

#### Purpose
To teach you about complex logic implementation, security best practices, and efficient data management in smart contracts.

#### Difficulty Level
`Difficult`

#### What You'll Be Integrating

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll integrate the vote smart contract with frontend components to create a fully functional Voting dApp. If you haven't integrated the Smart contract then please go through this [DAO dApp Smart Contract](https://docs.aelf.dev/quick-start/developers/dao-dapp/#step-2---develop-smart-contract).
  
After developing the dApp, youâ€™ll test its key functionalities by:

  - **Running the Application**: Testing the voting functionalities to ensure that proposals can be created, voted on, and their statuses updated in real-time.
  - **Creating a Portkey Wallet**: Portkey is a wallet that allows users to log in with Web2 social info, offering a seamless Web3 experience without private keys or mnemonics. You'll integrate this wallet into your dApp to manage user authentication and transactions.
  - **Connecting the Wallet**: Youâ€™ll connect the Portkey wallet to your DAO, enabling users to join the DAO, vote on proposals, and track proposal statuses.
  - **Interacting with the DAO**: Once connected, users can join the DAO, vote on predefined proposals, and even create new proposals directly through the frontend interface.

#### Letâ€™s Get Started

Letâ€™s begin by building the frontend components of our Voting dApp. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a robust application that showcases your understanding of decentralized decision-making and smart contract development. Ready? Letâ€™s dive in!
